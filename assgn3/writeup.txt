Assignment 1 Writeup


1.) 	Alex Kaylor, Jacob Pendergraff, CS 4318.001


2.)	Q: How often do you plan to work on the project? A: Ideally we would like to be able to set aside a couple hours
	a week to make progress on our projects. This is flexible of course; depending on our workload from our other classes
	we may end up having to spend more time on the project nearer to the deadline.
	
	Q: What software platform do you plan to use for collaboration? A: We have a few avenues of communication set up already.
	We have Teams if necessary but so far communicating via text and GitHub commits has been enough to comfortably get the job done.


3.) 	While testing the code we occasionally altered the existing test files to account for certain tokens and scenarios that weren't
	already present, and for convenience of testing the exact semantic errors we were interested in at any given time.

4.) Testing Examples

    We needed to test a file without errors just to see if we were outputting the symbol table properly, so we created a test case
    without semantic errors and with multiple functions and calls to verify that scope was being outputted properly.
    Test01.mC:
    void eggsalad (int arg1){
    }
    void main () {
 	eggsalad ();
    }

    New_Test_Assign_3.mC:
    void main() {
    int x;
    }

    We also reused some test cases from assignment 2 for the purpose of validating the program's output on more files without
    existing semantic errors, such as testArithExpr.mC

5.) 
Alex: Initialized Project files and updated strtab.c with new functions for assignment 3. Also implemented code for most error cases.
Jacob: Implemented scope functions in parser and updated code to work with nested scope tables. Wrote a few remaining error cases.
