Assignment 1 Writeup


1.) 	Alex Kaylor, Jacob Pendergraff, CS 4318.001


2.)	Q: How often do you plan to work on the project? A: Ideally we would like to be able to set aside a couple hours
	a week to make progress on our projects. This is flexible of course; depending on our workload from our other classes
	we may end up having to spend more time on the project nearer to the deadline.
	
	Q: What software platform do you plan to use for collaboration? A: We have a few avenues of communication set up already.
	We have Teams if necessary but so far communicating via text and GitHub commits has been enough to comfortably get the job done.


3.) 	While testing the code we occasionally altered the existing test files to account for certain tokens and scenarios that weren't
	already present. For example, the test1.mC file contains "01" as a token to test whether the scanner can handle integers with
	leading zeros, but it has no test cases for valid integers or for 0 on it's own. To remedy this we altered the test files as
	needed to try out scenarios that may not have already existed on the files as they were given to us.

	Additionally we made use of Regex101.com as a quick and easy way to test out our regular expressions without having to go
	through the process of editing our files and remaking them each time. This saved a lot of valuable time and allowed us to
	try out regular expressions on the fly.

4.) Testing Examples
    cat <tests/<filename>.mC | obc/Scanner
    The files are named: commenttests.mC, MyTest2.mC, and stringtests.mC
	Contents

	commenttests.mC:
	/* single line comment */
	/* multi line comment
	// multi line comment
	// multi line comment
	*/ int 

	/*unterminated

    MyTest2.mC:
	100
	101
	011
	500000000

	stringtests.mC:
	"hi"
	"hi how are
	you"
